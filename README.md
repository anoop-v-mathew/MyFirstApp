# MyFirstApp
My first Android App, developed using the Android development tutorial (https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html). 

I hope to commit every day, moving from one section of the tutorial to the next, in my journey to become a competent Android developer! Each commit, unless a section is too complex, will contain the code changes for that particular tutorial section.
